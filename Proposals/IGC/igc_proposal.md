Our Chapter resolves to pursue the creation of a new Independent Greek Council (IGC) at the University of Utah in order to create a governing body that:
* Pursues a modern form of Greek Life whose priority is to assist organizations in bettering its' members, our campus, and the broader community;
* Does not suffer a skew in representation towards larger organizations;
* Allows its' member organizations independence in how they pursue their missions; and

Our Chapter resolves that the leadership of our Chapter will focus on creating support for this IGC among both Greek organizations and the administration at the University of Utah.

Our Chapter resolves that we shall finalize formal recognition of the IGC by the University, and be represented by this governing body, only after **two** other Greek organizations agree to join the IGC as founding members.

Our Chapter resolves to establish the IGC as a founding member under the following Constitution and Resolutions:
