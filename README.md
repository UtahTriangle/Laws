# The Laws of the Utah Chapter of Triangle

This is the repository for all governing laws of our Chapter. These are divided into two catgeories:

- Our **Chapter Constitution** is the overarching document for our commitments to each other and to our Chapter.
- Our **Chapter Resolutions** are rules and procedures that our Chapter resolves to operate by.
